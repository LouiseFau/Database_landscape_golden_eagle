Summary : 

1.	The intensification of our extractive relation with nature coincides with a profound transformation of species. This transformation occurs primarily through changes in the behavioural repertoire of species. While the human role in enriching or maintaining the diversity of the species’ behavioural repertoires, i.e., behavioural plasticity, which favours rapid adaptation, has been recognised, the constraining effects of human pressures on the standing variation of the behavioural repertoire have received far less attention. Yet, a reduction in behavioural repertoire diversity through selection decreases species’ resilience to further anthropogenic change. 

2.	Using data from 64 juveniles golden eagles  (Aquila chrysaetos) from a population slowly recovering after intensive hunting, we tested whether the population’s limited range expansion resulted from avoidance of humans, either selected by past persecution or arising as a short-term response to the currently increasing distribution and density of humans in the alpine region. We performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on landscape features used during the pre-dispersal and the first fifteen weeks of the dispersal phase, and used Mahalanobis distance as an indicator for quantifying changes in individual spatial behaviour over time.

3.	Three dominant landscape utilisation strategies, Rangetop, Forest, and Valley, were identified, with the latter most strongly associated with human-modified areas, being the least used. Most individuals specialised in one strategy and displayed limited change in landscape use between the pre-dispersal and dispersal periods, thereby indicating an absence of individual learning to avoid human-modified areas.

4.	The observed behavioural variation in landscape utilization strategy is more consistent with behavioural plasticity than with strong directional selection for aversion to humans. This plasticity is more likely intergenerational, possibly shaped by nest habitat conditions or imitation of parental anthropophobic behaviours, than acquired individually by the juveniles.

5. Despite the past traumatic history of intense persecution, the golden eagle population retains behavioural plasticity.
