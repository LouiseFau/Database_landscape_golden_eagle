# Consistent use of landscape utilization strategies in dispersing juvenile golden eagles of the Alps

The first, called "Database", samples the GPS locations, extracts their associated terrain values, and reduces the dataset by pre-identifying and removing correlated landscape variables. Based on this pre-selection, the second script, "PCA&Analysis", performs a PCA, identifies and validates clusters using statistical indicators, and runs two randomizations: one based on the Mahalanobis distance between each consecutive week of the dispersal phase, and another based on the distance to the natal territory.
