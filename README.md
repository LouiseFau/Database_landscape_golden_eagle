# Consistent use of landscape utilization strategies in dispersing juvenile golden eagles of the Alps

This repository comprises four codes. The first one, called "Database", describe the sampling of the GPS locations and their associated terrain values. The second code, called "Variables selection", aims at reducing the dataset by pre-identifying and suppressing correlated landscape variables. On the basis of the pre-selection of the landscape variables, the third code "PCA" obtain a PCA and identify and validate using statistical indicators three clusters with each representing one type of landscape utilization strategy. The fourth code, "Randomisation & Mahalanobis", calculate the Mahalanobis distance between each 7-day sequence individual point in the PCA and compared it to randomely generated individuals to assess consistency in landscape use. It also identify three groups of individuals based on the variance and maximum of their Mahalanobis distance calculated from the pre-dispersal individual point and each of the fifteen 7-day individual sequence point of the dispersal period.
